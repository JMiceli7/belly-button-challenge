# belly-button-challenge

In this assignment, I was tasked with creating an interative visualization based on a Belly Button Biodiversity dataset housed in a json file.

To create the visualizations, a js file built. The js file utilizes the d3 library to read in samples from the json file previously mentioned. 

From these samples, it was possible to create both an interactive bar chart and bubble chart.

Both charts are fully ineractive when the html file loaded to a browser on a local server. Code was added to the js file for a drop down that allows you to select and filter from a list of the samples loaded from the json file. 

This server was deployed using Pages from this github repository.
